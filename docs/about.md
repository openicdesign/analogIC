analogIC is my public notebook: every lecture lands in markdown, the toolchain
stays open, and everything is bundled into one
[book]({{ '/assets/analogic.pdf' | relative_url }}) for students, hobbyists, and
engineers who want to follow along.

The project now sits under [AI-Silicon](https://aisi.asicedu.com), where I test
AI copilots, reproducible scripts, and open-source tools for real analog flows.
Here you will find:

- concise lecture notes and workshop slides,
- reproducible SPICE and Python projects,
- links to the public repos, datasets, and experiments that document what I am
  building.

If that mix of teaching, tooling, and open-source work resonates with you,
reach out and help push analog design toward more transparent, collaborative
practices.
