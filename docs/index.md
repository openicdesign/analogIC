analogIC is a markdown-first notebook. All source files for the lectures live in
[analogIC](https://aisi.asicedu.com/analogIC), and every release of the
site is generated from those plain-text notes.

## Slides and sketches

I storyboard lectures in Markdown decks, then present them with
[Deckset](https://www.deckset.com) or [Marp](https://marp.app) depending on the
room setup. When I need diagrams, I draw them on the iPad with Notability or
OneNote and drop the exported images right back into the Markdown sources.

I've compiled all the lecture notes into a [book]({{ '/assets/analogic.pdf' | relative_url }}).
